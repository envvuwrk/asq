To get you started, we\u2019ve put together a comprehensive list of the best 100 tools for ecommerce, all of them vetted and approved by the team here at Studio. We sorted our tools into the following categories: <\/p>\n\n<p>You won\u2019t see any \u201ccore\u201d tools like ecommerce platforms or CRM software on our list. Instead we focused on the supplemental tools that will make your core systems more successful. Similarly, we steered clear of apps and plugins built for a single platform and opted instead for tools and systems that integrate with most ecommerce platforms.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We looked for free and inexpensive tools whenever possible, but we&#8217;ve included the paid tools that are worth the price of admission. To help you out, we&#8217;ve segmented each section by price.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our list includes one Studio partner, Jungle Scout. Aside from that, we have no relationship with any of the companies on our list \u2014 except, in many cases, as a customer! Most of these are tools we use regularly ourselves or on behalf of our clients. Whenever that isn\u2019t the case, our research is based on customer reviews and comparisons across features and pricing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Setting Up Shop&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/yS1FAFK4r_MQ2e33PbEODvvmz6_ZzHo5nQfnYZ2WOL-ctqCRKa5sKSkkhCc0cDdz6K42A0_1ldgP-wL5r1yHU74UhmUWfWRaS6vOkPt07g9SVLqD5bInlmexSd7WOXDcMVTI83Hd\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>If you\u2019re still in the ideating, product research and planning phase, these are the tools for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Ecommerce Product Research&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Free:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>1. <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/?geo=US\">Google Trends <\/a>&#8211; Is your product idea up and coming, or has it already peaked?

Two things that set Partial.ly apart: a) They pay your Square fee, and b) on the customer end, payment options are highly customizable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>54. <a href=\"https:\/\/rechargepayments.com\/\">ReCharge Payments<\/a> &#8211; If you want to sell subscriptions or set up recurring billing, ReCharge is a clean and easy way to add the functionality to your site. Pricing starts at $40 per month, plus 5 cents and 1% per transaction. We looked at other subscription software options and this price seems standard. Before you pony up for a tool, look into: a) your ecommerce platform, b) your inventory management system, and c) Zoho and similar tools. You can often find this functionality hiding in the native features of the tools you\u2019re already using.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Marketing Your Online Store&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/xIspzQ3NQOzG9QM8T5LNb-g78zZYIU7JzXFBHxDne_6B9JuXcmtEarH6sPbz18GEwG7k_XlVwiNdNdgxEWTpZMlSp2T7cLJfvH8GjKj3Ll8YNpuKwONYAlDbnn2OBAgz9LxSXAc6\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>These marketing tools make every facet of growing your audience easier, from creating keyword-rich content to partnering with the right influencers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Advertising<\/h3>\n<p>55. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.criteo.com\/\">Criteo <\/a>&#8211; This suite of advertising solutions includes dynamic retargeting, in-app ads and more.

There are limitations to the method, but there are no other free keyword research tools that will give you this level of detail.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>66. <a href=\"https:\/\/answerthepublic.com\/\">Answer The Public<\/a> &#8211; A longstanding secret weapon for content strategists and keyword researchers alike, Answer The Public pairs your keyword with common question words (who, what, where, when, why, how); prepositions (with, without, for, can); comparison words (vs, like, and, or) and each letter in the alphabet to reveal the most common queries for those entries.

It\u2019s free to download and use the desktop tool for up to 500 URLs. If your site has more than 500 pages, the tool is $183 per year (Screaming Frog is UK-based, so the unusual price is due to the pounds-to-dollars conversion).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>70. <a href=\"https:\/\/technicalseo.com\/tools\/schema-markup-generator\/\">Merkle Schema Generator<\/a> &#8211; Merkle has done a great job of developing an easy-to-use web app that helps SEOs quickly and cleanly generate properly structured schema for their site. At the link you can create schema for articles, breadcrumbs, events, FAQs, how-to\u2019s, job postings, local business, organizations, personas, products, recipes, videos, and websites. <\/p>\n<p>71. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seoquake.com\/index.html\">SEO Quake<\/a> &#8211; SEO Quake is a handy browser extension that pros use to quickly mine data about any web page they visit.

Verifying your website with Search Console will give you a glimpse into how your site is performing and indexing in Google Search. Information includes impressions, CTR, and the average rank of your pages for&nbsp;the keywords you rank for.

The paid plan also grants you access to additional tools for keyword research and rank tracking.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Worth The Price:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/9R5DMgmU1dzZhHyO7FEUyC1eJtTUv9s6uW2Lod6NX1ug3aEDXrS7Om5-t9poDbhUonbgXA5V4gTWAPG-h1UUH0K8LnV9V9b3bQG8FRyc9HezbUGg_0pWI-yZ95r7VLzzB9sbMDfb\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>75. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/\">SEMRush <\/a>&#8211; This all-in-one marketing and SEO suite is chock full of features, dashboards and competitor research tools.

Pricing ranges from $29-$599\/month.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>79. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tailwindapp.com\/\">Tailwind<\/a> &#8211; While the other social scheduling tools struggle a bit with Instagram and Pinterest scheduling, Tailwind excels at it.

It\u2019s free to get started, and the paid plans for Pinterest and Instagram are each $10.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>80. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.outfy.com\/\">Outfy <\/a>&#8211; Outfy integrates with your ecommerce platform so you can sell on all the major social media platforms using product images and information pulled directly from your online store. It has a nice range of templates, too. Pricing is a bit confusing; Outfy charges 4-6 cents per product posted on social media (they call it a \u201cshare\u201d), and the commission changes according to the plan you choose. Plans start free and range up to $60 for a lifetime, and $60 will net you the lowest commission fee per share. You can also purchase shares in bulk for an even lower commission fee (if you buy 7200 shares up-front for $180, you\u2019ll only be charged 2.5 cents a share).

Like all social platforms, this one\u2019s only as good as the number of people who sign up for it. But since it\u2019s free for merchants, signing up is low-risk (you\u2019ll negotiate payment with your influencers individually).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Inexpensive:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>83. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzstream.com\/\">Buzzstream <\/a>&#8211; One of <em>the <\/em>tools to have in your toolkit for linkbuilding and PR, Buzzstream is a search engine for blogs, influencers and publishers.

PowerReviews is the system that makes this type of marketing scalable by putting your product in front of hundreds of microinfluencers. Because the options are so customizable, you\u2019ll have to ask for a quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>85. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gatsby.ai\/\">Gatsby.ai<\/a> &#8211; If you\u2019re interested in moving from micro to macro influencers, Gatsy automates the process of finding and reaching out to them. The self-service option is $99\/month.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>86. <a href=\"https:\/\/hypeauditor.com\/\">HypeAuditor <\/a>&#8211; HypeAuditor sets itself apart from other influencer discovery tools by putting influencer data under the lense.

This is the easiest way to find out if your site passes the mobile bar.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Note: the free page speed tools only test the URL you give them; they don\u2019t crawl your full site.

But the third-party reviews for this dynamic heatmap tool are solid, and we couldn\u2019t find any red flags (just the giant orange one). If you\u2019re looking for a standalone heatmap tool, this one\u2019s a super affordable $10-$100 per month.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>92. <a href=\"https:\/\/mixpanel.com\/\">Mixpanel <\/a>&#8211; Mixpanel is a full suite of behavioral analytics and user testing tools, including A\/B testing.
