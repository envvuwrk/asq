If only it were that easy! Before they can start picking hero graphics for their new home page, businesses that sell food and other perishable goods have more fundamental concerns. Namely, how can they make sure the customer\u2019s order is as fresh as possible when it arrives so the customer has ample time to enjoy it?\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If you sell food, preservative-free cosmetics, or other items that expire quickly, you might have questions about whether selling online is viable for your business. Common concerns include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul><li>Should I work with my existing menu or mix up what I offer online so I can build in more shipping-friendly items?&nbsp;<\/li><li>As I transition to consumer packaged goods, what regulations should I be aware of?&nbsp;<\/li><li>How can I ship an item that needs to stay refrigerated?&nbsp;<\/li><li>What if my customer doesn\u2019t get their order before it expires?&nbsp;<\/li><li>How do I manage inventory for high-turnover products?&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>We\u2019ll answer all these questions and more as we walk you through everything you need to know about selling perishable goods online.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Should You Sell Perishables Online?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>First of all, this is a 100% doable business model. Food and beverage ecommerce is a fast-growing sector, with revenue that\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/257532\/us-food-and-beverage-e-commerce-revenue\/\">expected to hit $26 billion by 2022<\/a>. Popular brands like Blue Apron and Hello Fresh have perfected the art of the refrigerated delivery, and fulfillment centers give you the chance to warehouse and ship products locally no matter where you\u2019re based.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The question isn\u2019t <em>can <\/em>you sell perishables online, but <em>should <\/em>you? If you\u2019re a restaurant and you\u2019ve never touched ecommerce before, you know the transition won\u2019t be as simple as packaging up existing favorites and shipping them. You won\u2019t be making a pivot so much as rotating into a new sector entirely. Outside of local delivery, your lovingly-prepared and plated menus will only minimally help you as you determine how you\u2019ll build a shipping-friendly product line. Then there are news labels and packaging to purchase, regulations to keep up with, and an entire logistical arm to add to your business that didn\u2019t exist before (fulfillment and shipping).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is, you\u2019re more likely to succeed if you think of going online not as a seamless transition from running a restaurant or local shop but as a new venture entirely. This isn\u2019t a switch you can flip on and then flip off again when things return to normal; it takes too much work and time to get an online business off the ground to treat it as a casual solution. Manage your expectations so you don\u2019t feel financially or mentally blindsided when you encounter many of the same issues you faced in the earliest stages of your business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve already \u201cdone your time\u201d with startups and\/or your passion for your business is rooted in the restaurant world, channel your efforts into that. Double down on local marketing and make sure you\u2019ve seized every possible local pickup and delivery option. If you\u2019re ready to establish an ecommerce presence and help that part of your business take off, your existing infrastructure puts you <em>way <\/em>ahead of the pack \u2014 not to mention your industry knowledge and deep understanding of your customer base. You have all the right ingredients for a successful ecommerce store!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Unless you\u2019re ready to pull a full Hello Fresh, think less about how you might replicate entire dishes and more about how you can package up the local flavors that make people love your restaurant. Does everyone go crazy for that secret sauce? Sell it by the jar so people can use it in their recipes at home. Make a mean marionberry jam? Ship it. Are your house chips an underrated gem? Package them up so people can snack on them whenever they want.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You can also offer products inspired by your restaurant\u2019s menu. This allows you to stretch your creative wings and expand beyond literal duplications into items that will be practical and shipping-friendly. Can you concoct a salad dressing that will capture the magic of a favorite salad? Or whip up some truffles that embody the flavor of a favorite dessert? Or put together nonperishable \u201cdeconstructed\u201d recipes that only require the customer to add the perishable ingredient later? Perfect!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Regulations for Selling Perishables Online&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re already running a restaurant, your state\u2019s cottage food laws still apply. If you\u2019re starting a new business from scratch, these include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul><li>Food handling &amp; safety regulations&nbsp;<\/li><li>State business licenses&nbsp;<\/li><li>Zoning clearance and local permits&nbsp;<\/li><li>You must have a kitchen inspection made by the health department at least once a year<\/li><li>Additional commercial kitchen rules that vary by state&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Now for your introduction to a whole new set of regulations: labeling laws! According to FDA regulations, every food product should include a label and a complete disclosure of the ingredients. The label should also include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul><li>Net quantity&nbsp;<\/li><li>The weight of all ingredients combined&nbsp;<\/li><li>The name and location of the manufacturer&nbsp;<\/li><li>Nutrition information&nbsp;<\/li><li>Disclosure of food allergens, including whether the food was made in a kitchen that exposes it to cross-contamination from allergens&nbsp;<\/li><li>An expiration and\/or \u201csell by\u201d date<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>For more information, contact your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasda.org\/states\/state-directory\">state\u2019s Department of Agriculture<\/a> or your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.naccho.org\/membership\/lhd-directory\">local health department<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Shipping Perishable Foods&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>Non-Refrigerated Food&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>For non-refrigerated products, a \u201cFragile\u201d label will suffice from a legal standpoint. Don\u2019t skimp on packaging, though! Your packaging can make or break the quality of your shipment \u2014 literally. Look for vacuum-sealed wrapping, watertight containers, and tamper-proof seals. Even if the product doesn\u2019t require refrigeration, the FDA recommends that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fsis.usda.gov\/wps\/portal\/fsis\/topics\/food-safety-education\/get-answers\/food-safety-fact-sheets\/safe-food-handling\/mail-order-food-safety\/CT_Index\">packaged food items arrive to the customer at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Give each product the padding it needs to survive the journey, aiming for no movement within your inner and outer packaging. Even if you sell durable products, treat them like they\u2019re fragile; the shipping process can be tough on packages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Use the smallest box that will fit your products so you don\u2019t have to incur unnecessary extra costs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Try to get the package into the customer\u2019s hands as soon as possible. If that means you can\u2019t choose the most economical shipping options, build the cost into your product margins. Consider offering a local pickup option so you local customers can save a few dollars on shipping!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Refrigerated Food&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>For refrigerated or frozen food, work with UPS or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fedex.com\/en-us\/shipping\/perishables.html\">FedEx<\/a>; both offer same-day or next-day shipping, and both ship refrigerated products all the time. In fact, UPS has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ups.com\/us\/en\/services\/knowledge-center\/article.page?kid=art16a454e6661\">a handy guide to shipping with dry ice<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of the provider you choose, the insulation is largely up to you. Most people use a combination of dry ice or gel packs, styrofoam coolers, and insulated pads and liners. Display information prominently on the outer packaging that lets your shipping provider know there\u2019s refrigerated food in the package. Your shipping provider should also be made aware of this beforehand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Expect a 2-3 pound refrigerated package to cost about $30-150 to ship. Whew! Use this option only if your products have a high price point. If you can\u2019t make it work with your budget, look to alternatives like using local fulfillment centers or, better still, selling wholesale to local grocery stores.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/u6uxZLfZuk__DmubtndMDmzL4nYfu4vAXOZF48ltcUyp7DoXC_ZhFs97vkvkJrvNeNYKL6kuRnsejjudCXZRJpM1xEhitepdl9CRZs_lNvnTfuGt_1EAXPUx41kVKQ\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fsis.usda.gov\/wps\/portal\/fsis\/topics\/food-safety-education\/get-answers\/food-safety-fact-sheets\/safe-food-handling\/mail-order-food-safety\/CT_Index\">U.S. Department of Agriculture<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n<h2><strong>Managing Customer Expectations&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Selling perishables means communicating with your customers as much as possible. Starting on the product page, make nutrition information clear and set the proper expectations for shipping. Shore up your return policy and communicate it clearly to your customers.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t make the customer liable for food that arrives late and\/or spoiled. Refund or replace their purchase, and explore the issue with your shipping provider if you notice a pattern emerging. If your customer just doesn\u2019t like what they purchased, use your discretion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After your customer has checked out, reiterate shipping information in your confirmation email and notify them again when the product ships. If they need to be home for the delivery, include information about the delivery window as early as possible and give them a fast way to contact their shipping provider if they need a different time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like more information about marketing and selling your food products online, check out the following posts:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.growwithstudio.com\/blog\/food-ecommerce-guide\">The Ultimate Ecommerce Guide for the Food Industry<\/a>&nbsp;<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.growwithstudio.com\/blog\/seo-for-the-food-industry\">SEO For the Food Industry: Just E-A-T<\/a>&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>And of course, we\u2019re always happy at Grow With Studio to help you get set up right.
