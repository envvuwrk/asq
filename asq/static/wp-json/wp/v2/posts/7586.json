How will you get an outsider up to speed on regulatory quirks or technical information? How will a digital marketer communicate the benefits of your products to your customers if they\u2019re not fluent in your industry\u2019s language? Should you just hire an in-house marketer instead?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Not so fast. The situation isn\u2019t as black-or-white as you think, and \u2014 as we\u2019ll see shortly \u2014 expert-level knowledge of your industry isn\u2019t a requisite as long as your marketer has expert-level knowledge of their <em>own <\/em>industry. This post will demystify a common concern about working with digital marketing agencies when your products are niche or technical in nature.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Should You Work With An Agency or In-House Marketer?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<p>Trick question! Most businesses use a blend of agency and in-house marketers, and there\u2019s good reason to do so.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In-house hires have the specialized insider knowledge you\u2019re looking for; if they don\u2019t, living and breathing your business for 40+ hours a week will have them up to speed in no time. Therein lies the benefit of in-house hires: they are 100% focused on <em>your <\/em>business. Your culture. The ins and outs of your products. They know that when they have questions, the right team member is just a Slack chat away. They know what the top customer concerns are, and they know how your sales team turns on-the-fence prospects into loyal customers. That\u2019s huge! In-house hires develop a level of fluency with your products that an agency hire would not have the bandwidth to replicate without making a full-tilt career change into your industry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So why does anyone ever bother with agencies at all? Well, we\u2019ve already established that it\u2019s difficult to find people with specialized knowledge in paid media, SEO, or copywriting <em>and <\/em>in highly niche industries. The inverse is also true: you\u2019re going to have a hard time staffing your business with people who know your industry but also have those highly specialized marketing skills. And at the end of the day, you need a digital marketing team with an extensive background in digital marketing.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a lot more economical to work with agencies, despite the discrepancy you\u2019re likely to find if you compare hourly rates. Here\u2019s the thing: your agencies are working billable hours. Your employees, for the most part, are not. You\u2019re paying a huge amount of overhead for your creative employees to put in 8+ hours of work per day for five days a week despite the human brain\u2019s literal inability to actually perform that much creative work in a day. When it comes to creativity and problem-solving, our brains max out around four hours; according to Inc.com, the average employee actually puts in less than this, clocking around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/melanie-curtin\/in-an-8-hour-day-the-average-worker-is-productive-for-this-many-hours.html\">two hours of productive work per day<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re not working with machines, and businesses with a happy workplace culture understand that. So they spend a significant amount of overhead \u2014 about six hours per employee per day, if Inc.com is correct \u2014 letting employees recharge, zone out, participate in meetings that aren\u2019t always productive, and otherwise have the space they need to think creatively. And that\u2019s on top of sick days, vacation days, holidays, off days, team-building outings, and more. On top of <em>that<\/em>, in-house specialists also need equipment and specialized paid tools (for example: our SEO team at Grow With Studio uses about ten different paid tools regularly, and that\u2019s a conservative guess).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When you work with an agency, the extra amount you pay per hour pales in comparison to the amount you save when you <em>only pay for the time spent on productive work. <\/em>It\u2019s <em>our <\/em>business\u2019s job to foot the bill for the care and keeping of employees, not yours.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>What To Look for In an Agency&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<p>Okay, you\u2019re convinced: you\u2019re going to find an agency partner to help you with your digital marketing strategy. How much experience <em>should <\/em>your prospective agency have with your industry?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a complicated question. Remember, we\u2019re talking about highly specialized industries: think aviation aeroducts and other aviation parts, not general hardware. If you fall into the latter category, it\u2019s safe to assume your prospective digital agency has worked with businesses like yours in the past. If you fall into the former category, finding an industry-experienced agency partner may be more of a roll of the dice (but don\u2019t be surprised if your prospective agency does have that experience! If they\u2019ve been around for ten years or more, they\u2019ve probably seen it all).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Instead of starting with your offering at the most specific level and working out, start with broad categories and work your way in. For our aviation parts example, that might look like:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>B2B &gt; Ecommerce &gt; Industrial &gt; Aviation Parts<\/p>\n<p>Or it might look like:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>B2C &gt; Ecommerce &gt; Hardware &gt; Aviation Parts; or B2C &gt; Ecommerce &gt; Hobbies &gt; Aviation&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now you have control over setting the category level where experience is a must. It\u2019s more than reasonable to expect your agency to have extensive experience with your two outer categories (ecommerce, B2B, B2C, etc), and you can also expect them to have worked successfully in the past with clients from your third-level category (industrial\/hobbies\/hardware\/etc). Just keep in mind that the deeper you\u2019ve moved in your category levels, the less mandatory insider experience is.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>That said, there are a number of agencies that make one industry (legal, automotive, medical, etc) their bread and butter. It\u2019s worth pursuing these options if you\u2019re commissioning a highly technical ebook or want a PR representative with contacts at niche publications. If you\u2019re looking for help with SEO, paid media, social media, web design, and (to a large extent) copywriting&#8230;the niche overlap is mostly a marketing ploy on the agency\u2019s end. It gives them a differentiator and lets them target you in a more specific way (which isn\u2019t wrong, by the way; that\u2019s what you did when you picked a niche, too). Let the granular level of industry experience serve as a tie-breaker if you need one, but it\u2019s not a selling point in itself.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Your agency should be much more excited to tell you about their background in the field you need help with (SEO, PPC, etc) than to tell you about the number of lawyers they\u2019ve worked with. In fact, that level of industry specialization can even be a red flag sometimes, because digital marketing itself is such a specialized field. Listen for specific, actionable marketing strategies, not vague or high-level promises.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Finally, head over to your prospective agency\u2019s case <a href=\"https:\/\/www.growwithstudio.com\/case-studies\">studies section<\/a> and read the ones for businesses that overlap with yours in 2-3 layers of business category. Pay attention to the agency&#8217;s approach with this client, including the specific tactics they used. If you want to know a secret, this part is more important than the numbers; it takes full context to understand the relative strength or weakness of results, but you\u2019ll always be able to tell if the specific approach seems comprehensive and well-executed. Moreover, you can start thinking about whether a similar approach might be right for your business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s that, you say? Your prospective agency doesn\u2019t <em>have <\/em>any case studies? Maybe they list the logos of clients they\u2019ve worked with, but you can\u2019t click on them to learn more? That\u2019s a sign that your \u201cagency\u201d is actually just a guy with a business license who invented an agency or consulting group out of thin air so he can call himself the CEO\/CMO. This is a common solution for people who aren&#8217;t qualified to get formally hired for the director-level position they think they deserve, and they won\u2019t have the specialized marketing background to help you. Look for case studies.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>(Note: Don\u2019t rule out freelancers who identify themselves properly! Do ask them for work samples, too).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Building Thought Leadership Within a Specialized Field&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019re working with your agency, you\u2019ll notice that copywriting is the area where the lack of an industry background is most likely to cause friction. By extension, some parts of your SEO strategy might encounter the same issue. Writers are flexible, and it won\u2019t be hard for a content strategist or copywriter to pick up your brand\u2019s voice and key talking points. You may run into problems, however, if you need advanced-level content for industry thought leadership articles.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, this challenge is fully surmountable as long as you give your copywriter a little help. Common solutions include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul><li>Let your writer interview in-house experts and write up the interview.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>Have an in-house expert outline the article or draft information in bullet point form; your writer will be able to turn it into a narrative that flows.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>Have an in-house expert edit the article so they can validate that all the right information was included and accurately conveyed.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Your writer will also, of course, do their own research so they can get an understanding of your industry, but remember how long it took <em>you <\/em>to develop your expertise and manage your expectations accordingly. As long as you don\u2019t expect your writer to be the ultimate expert on your industry, you\u2019ll be able to provide them with the resources you both need to run a successful strategy. If you <em>do <\/em>need someone with that level of expertise, hire a technical writer and pair them with your SEO specialist, who can leverage out of all that great content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is, look for an agency that knows their respective marketing domain first and foremost. Marketers know how to do their research and tailor best practices for each business they work with. The rest will fall into place, leading to results that make <em>everyone <\/em>happy \u2014 especially your bottom line!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you work in an industry that requires highly specialized knowledge, you might find the idea of working with a digital marketing&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":33,"featured_media":7587,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"image","meta":[],"categories":[219],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.9.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Does Niche Industry Experience Matter In A Digital Marketing Agency? - Grow With Studio<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Worried that your niche or technical industry will make it impossible to contract out marketing work?
