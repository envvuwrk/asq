But as online competition grows ever fiercer, they\u2019re now turning to the consumer-friendly branding strategies long practiced by their B2C cousins.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In fact, designers in every industry can draw inspiration from auto industry websites, from the consumer-savvy manufacturers at the helm to usability-first auto supply websites. Check out our favorite industry trends below:<\/p>\n<h2>1. Sleek, Minimalist Styling<\/h2>\n<p>It might seem counterintuitive, but there\u2019s a lot of overlap between the automotive and tech worlds when it comes to branding. Both industries trend toward visuals that highlight a similar set of ideals: speed, progress, power, and a focus on cutting edge technology. The design elements that embody these qualities are chrome-tinged and polished to perfection.\u00a0<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/PBetX4KWhfqLfsw4kK34cE5ROxfTLdKJUIdmWKEC6_Q8nPQdJV5JOVum_yEdg731f_3JDeChDYpkECW0rU_ocDEw58xfALpx0pikA_l8wRplyGv2SvSTuu0x9FREkEezPFQzJb3O\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>No brand blurs the line between tech and automotive quite like Tesla, pictured above.\u00a0From their dark colors and aerodynamic lines to frequent PR crossovers with SpaceX, Tesla wants you to know that to own a Tesla is to invest in the future. <\/p>\n<h2>2. Product Searches Made Easy\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>Ecommerce sites with large product catalogs are driven by the need to help customers find what they want as quickly as possible. So it\u2019s no surprise that the best auto supply websites, which sell tens of thousands of parts, have all cracked the code behind efficient product searches. Sites like this have a tendency to reject some of the slickness we see on more consumer-friendly automotive sites. Instead, they favor the cleanest and simplest interface that will get the job done.\u00a0<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/4wkRT010u_IO36ioDcUjBf6ZAXF6ZchpPNuVIHb3NcXqfgw3tizNbrFV1BfNP5SpSis4YYDcBCMLpSlPtCCY9p69hATh5RC3SgM_sxCwDnskaHJKy0VcG0biwrL0AeDbIFAV3z83\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>The auto parts supplier AutoZone accomplishes this with not one, but two site search features displayed prominently on the home page. Users can enter their search directly if they know exactly what they\u2019re looking for. If they don\u2019t, they can use the drop-down tool to fill information about their vehicle\u2019s make and model so the website can help narrow down their options.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>3. 3D Images &amp; Virtual Showrooms\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>Long before automotive ecommerce became widespread, furniture and apparel retailers struggled with the challenge of helping online shoppers benefit from the same information that in-store shoppers had at their fingertips: size, comfort, fit, and the overall impression of the product after viewing it up close. Creative solutions to the challenge, including 360-degree views and virtual showrooms, paved the way for dealerships testing out an ecommerce model.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/EIgqX2Deyvm4SnMdZI-DCzkxsMINEPmOye-d0uCF2wpW391X_-rffrBxsmX86iyYzVajmgsJgDj5E52F-F0hiutLPQWm0oUkEyCWhiHJ34-KVZVUq2YFiCs7plvINJilfLC1grkY\" width=\"624\" height=\"369\"><\/h2>\n<p>For Carvana, one of the first fully-ecommerce auto dealerships to emerge, perfecting the virtual showroom was an integral part of helping customers feel comfortable making large purchases sight-unseen. Prospective buyers can take a 360-degree look at the vehicle\u2019s interior and exterior, open doors and trunks, and get a detailed rundown of imperfections if the car is used. Shoppers also have easy access to documents that include a 150-point inspection and the car\u2019s Kelly Blue Book value.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>4. Lifestyle Imagery\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s no surprise that car manufacturers have been pioneers in branding from the very beginning \u2014 they have a big story to tell, and they don\u2019t have a lot of time to tell it. While you might think of driving shots or clean product showrooms as the bread and butter of automotive branding, manufacturers actually rely heavily on lifestyle imagery to tell their story.\u00a0<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/1lJ9q7bidWWmxmbdjGwaSnd1FCxd8cNJczt7vHqxvLpv1uzqt4saLhBMUIvP6PEvhHWUp5AY1rDA-4IQukizkzsjhiH-wB3uJoEVMc3rH1N-4fVLyudD_3Ydk87GhW-yedAkPyCW\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>Take Porsche, for example. The luxury auto retailer isn\u2019t shy about portraying the lifestyle its target market connects to. Featuring impossibly good-looking people, professional attire, and lavish-yet-attainable settings, the brand sets up an aspirational ideal. With enough reinforcement, people will come to associate that ideal with owning a Porsche.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>5. Precision-Focused Persona Targeting\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>When auto manufacturers identify their core personas, the results aren\u2019t subtle. Watch a pickup truck commercial in Texas and you\u2019ll see sweeping landscapes punctuated by Americana and rugged, salt-of-the-earth people. Watch a Jeep commercial in Utah and you\u2019ll be greeted by off-roaders and adventure-seekers. Watch an SUV commercial in a major city and the imagery will shift to soccer games, camping, and families. On the whole, you won\u2019t have to guess who the brand\u2019s target market is; they\u2019ll hit you over the head with it.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s actually not a bad thing. It\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of thinking you\u2019re doing it wrong if you can\u2019t express your brand values subtly or if you feel like you\u2019re shouting who your core audience is from the rooftops. But those reservations are based on the assumption that people are paying as much attention to your brand as <em>you <\/em>are. Car manufacturers know better than anyone that when the world\u2019s attention is divided between millions of brands, it\u2019s okay to use shortcodes to tell your story.\u00a0<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/u69QhWa2cw0YDO-5Z67sJR9HpKJ6_M8QRwnzhBGzs044DUbM0q3dpRtdJGN38l8gjtpXejP1YZhZDJ_72HJN95DyJmB0oe6SdgmvTlO4QDZ0IWKc-dvNkkQgCXjaMPQFtiAh6Pb_\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>No brand knows its target market quite like Subaru. The outdoorsy and down-to-earth cars are a favorite in the Pacific Northwest, so Subaru\u2019s imagery and messaging is designed to resonate with Northwest values. Their product shots often aren\u2019t complete without a couple of bikes on the roof and a messy golden retriever in the back seat. And their messaging, while never overly political, aligns with liberal Northwest values by emphasizing love, individuality and environmental activism.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>6. Trust-Inspiring Iconography\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to trust, mechanics and doctors have a lot in common. Snake oil salesmen lurk in both industries, and there tends to be a big knowledge gap between the doctor or mechanic and the audience. When those factors combine, customers get jumpy \u2014 how can they know they\u2019re not being taken for a ride? One way to accomplish this efficiently is with icons and other visual cues that convey trust.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/EaFX1i3KIyj23O5fjkcUM-bN4__dXz6x5iYfnNUc-MiKRPWq2vdTlSt6BRH63QO9ZnGCcSjieywN8bta4MB68cEkrlo57kafFyHF6oQ4VFE-r00OzLgCUL0MBOHeRNmZ_xEdHFdr\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>Your Mechanic, a mobile mechanic website, prominently features visually- and verbally-clear icons that sum up three major reasons you can trust them. On top of that, they cleverly list the names and logos of popular publications that have featured the business, creating an implicit association between those trusted brands and the mechanic. Last, they connect their brand to a friendly face by eschewing slick imagery for warm, smiling candid shots of mechanics hard at work. <\/p>\n<p>If your own business operates in an industry you wouldn\u2019t naturally connect to great branding, take inspiration from the auto industry: your brand doesn\u2019t have to be kooky, slick or full of buzzwords to connect. It just has to be <em>you<\/em>.
