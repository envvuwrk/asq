Last year\u2019s Cyber Monday marked the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/12\/25\/reuters-america-corrected-record-online-sales-give-u-s-holiday-shopping-season-a-boost-report.html\">biggest online shopping day in U.S. history<\/a>, hitting record sales of over $3.4 billion. And as impressive as last year\u2019s numbers are, this season\u2019s holiday sales are expected to surpass them by a landslide: according to Statistica, online spending for the 2020 holiday season will generate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/topics\/1103\/holiday-season-e-commerce\/\">a predicted $134 billion in revenue<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Why such bold predictions? Ecommerce sales have already been on a steady incline over the past few years (a 20% increase in the 2019 holiday season compared to 2018, according to Statista). We were already expecting that trend to continue, and then COVID-19 went and threw gasoline on the fire. People have no <em>choice <\/em>but to shop online this year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now mix in some market volatility, a contentious election season, postal system slowdowns, and a high likelihood of extreme weather&#8230;and we\u2019re in for a bumpy ride this year, folks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we\u2019ve spent the last couple months building a cache of holiday-related content on the Grow With Studio blog. Experts from each digital marketing team have pitched in with posts ranging from planning your holiday email campaign to dealing with USPS slowdowns. This guide will help you organize your calendar and point you to those resources, while providing its own set of tips and takeaways for each digital marketing strategy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re not going to beat around the bush here: this is a crazy time for all of us. That doesn\u2019t mean your business has to take a hit. While there&#8217;s no telling what the next few months will bring, you can get yourself on track now and organize your 2020 holiday ecommerce planning. Come November, you\u2019ll have the best possible chance to conquer the holidays this season!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>2020 Holiday Resources&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ll link to these posts again when we discuss their respective strategies, but why force you to dig?

A new launch during a high-traffic period for your store is a recipe for disaster. Note your store\u2019s seasonal booms and busts, and plan full-scale redesigns for your slowest period. Your organic traffic might take a slight hit with the new design install while search engines re-crawl your site, so launching during your slow period gives you plenty of time to ramp back up for your busier seasons.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Still itching for a design refresh before the holidays? No problem! There are plenty of changes you can make, from swapping out merchandising photos to making new hero graphics, that won\u2019t cause a massive shakeup for your site. We share a few ideas here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.growwithstudio.com\/blog\/holiday-website-design-prep\">4 Easy Ways to Bring Some Holiday Cheer to Your Website Design.&nbsp;<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Promotions and Sales<\/strong>: <strong>If you haven\u2019t done so already, <\/strong>map out the promotions or sales you want to run through the end of the year. If any promotions necessitate new graphics, get those finished ASAP so you don\u2019t end up in a last-minute scramble. Front-load your work whenever you can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>PPC &amp; Paid Ads for the 2020 Holiday Season<\/h2>\n<p><strong>What to Prep:<\/strong> If you\u2019re going to run paid search campaigns during the holidays, our PPC pros recommend starting your prep work <strong>early to mid September.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We know, we know \u2014 it\u2019s October already. Don\u2019t sweat it if you\u2019re a couple weeks behind. If you bump the prep work to the top of your To-Do list and knock it out ASAP, you\u2019ll still have plenty of time to explore your data and build out your campaigns. Campaign prep includes:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Auditing keyword lists<\/li><li>Identifying top performers<\/li><li>Segmenting campaigns<\/li><li>Creating new audience lists<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><strong>Holiday-Related Ads<\/strong>: If you\u2019re running some holiday specials, you can get a few additional ducks in a row now:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Designing holiday sale- or gift-related landing pages&nbsp;<\/li><li>Writing new ad copy<\/li><li>Setting up promotions<\/li><li>Managing Promotion extensions<\/li><li>Creating and managing themed image ads<\/li><\/ul>\n<h3>Shopping Feeds for the Holidays<\/h3>\n<p><strong>New campaigns:<\/strong> The earlier you can start implementing your Google Shopping Feeds, the better \u2014 early implementation will let you troubleshoot any errors and get your feed in top shape before the holiday season.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Existing campaigns:<\/strong> If you have existing campaigns, it is a good idea to <strong>start prepping for the holiday season in October<\/strong>. You\u2019ll have less prep work than you would if you were to start a new feed campaign from scratch, but don\u2019t wait too long to make the adjustments you need for the holidays. Things move a bit slower in Q4 because there are more players on the field who need their feeds reviewed and sites indexed. That\u2019s especially true this year!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to Prep<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Start early to give yourself a buffer:<\/strong> Starting early on building and implementing your feed campaigns gives search engines the time they need to crawl and index your site after submitting your first data feed. Keep in mind, reviewing feeds and indexing sites can take longer in Q4 due to an increased number of sites getting on the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stock up on inventory<\/strong>: With more shoppers on the prowl for the best deals at the end of the year, make sure there\u2019s enough stock in place to fill a higher volume of sales. <strong>Start stocking up now<\/strong> to ensure you have enough to fulfill holiday orders.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Check your data:<\/strong> Ensure you have high quality product data for new items you add to the site for the holidays:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul><li>High resolution photos<\/li><li>Descriptive product titles and descriptions<\/li><li>Check that your products and site all follow <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/you-cant-advertise-that-the-big-list-of-prohibited-ads-across-social-and-search-platforms-322222\">search engine rules for advertising<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<p><strong>Check your Competitor\u2019s moves: <\/strong>Our Feeds experts recommend browsing sites that offer the same products or similar products and noting the deals your competition is offering. Then form your strategy, aiming to stay as competitive as possible. Running sales and offering things like discounted or free shipping can help your site stand out from the crowd when shoppers are comparing products.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Streamline your checkout process:<\/strong>&nbsp; Minimizing the number of clicks a user has to take from the product page to the order finished page should be a top priority for your site for the holidays (and year round!). <strong>Start removing any barriers to purchase in late October <\/strong>to allow visitors to get to that \u201cOrder Complete\u201d page and put dollars in your account faster.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Looking for more Google Shopping tips<\/strong> for the holidays?

To make your email marketing more scalable, <strong>create a few email templates ahead of time<\/strong> that you can use and reuse with new content each time you want to get the word out about a promotion. That way, you\u2019ve done most of the legwork already, and you\u2019ll just have to plug in the relevant content.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>SEO for the Holidays<\/h2>\n<p>Bad news first (followed by good, we promise): If you\u2019re trying to boost your site\u2019s organic presence before the holidays ramp up, it\u2019s best to get started mid-July or August. It takes time to build up enough content to get search engines to understand what makes your site relevant and different from the competition. If you weren\u2019t working with any SEO strategy at all before now, you may not get new pages ranked for the holidays, depending on the competitiveness of your niche.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>That said, there\u2019s good news a-plenty.<\/strong> Let\u2019s assume you\u2019re <em>not <\/em>a brand new site and your pages have already been able to build some natural organic traction before now. Optimizing these pages might slightly improve your rankings for the holidays, and it will certainly improve the odds of getting a customer to convert. The beauty of SEO work is that we don\u2019t just do it for the search engines; every on-page improvement we make also improves the customer experience. So don\u2019t assume work started now won\u2019t make a huge difference this holiday season; as long as it\u2019s geared toward making life more useful for the customer, it will help your business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, sites with high authority who write about time-sensitive topics can benefit from Google\u2019s \u201cfreshness algorithm,\u201d or its tendency to prioritize new content over old for time-sensitive subject matter. So the search engine will naturally be hungry for your fresh Black Friday content over, say, a competitor\u2019s Black Friday content from a year ago. You can produce content like this when the timing is appropriate and trust the search engine\u2019s ability to find it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>On-page SEO To-Dos:<\/strong> We recommend performing the following on-page work for your site:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul><li>Research keywords to identify important terms to use in your content<\/li><li>Optimize URLs with keyword phrases, making sure they\u2019re descriptive and user-friendly<\/li><li>Optimize meta titles and descriptions on every category page<\/li><li>Add descriptive alt text image tags on product pages<\/li><li><strong>Write optimized content, remembering that this is your time to really <\/strong><strong><em>sell <\/em><\/strong><strong>the product.<\/strong> Provide all the information your customer needs, making your differentiators and incentives clear. This is the sort of work that makes a difference above and beyond rankings, so take it seriously.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Double-check your product pages for usability, paying extra attention to page speed. Does the page load quickly? Are your images compressed? Can your server handle the amount of traffic you expect during the holidays, or is it time for an upgrade?&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><strong>Off-page SEO To-Dos:<\/strong> Using off-page SEO tactics, you can network with industry-related websites and incorporate social media to gain backlinks and turn your brand into an authority. <strong>S<\/strong><strong>tart gathering backlinks in October<\/strong>. Network with industry influencers online for product reviews, or offer to write guest blogs for popular bloggers or informational sites. See if you can get your products included in holiday gift guides and other promotional content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Additional off-page strategies can include <strong>being active on social media and developing email marketing campaigns in November and December to increase engagement<\/strong> with your brand. While these are year-round tasks, you can ramp up the efforts for them closer to the holidays for a bigger impact. Like your on-page SEO, your off-page SEO strategy isn\u2019t just about rankings; it\u2019s a crucial way to generate buzz and introduce new customers to your brand!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For more SEO tips and tricks, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.growwithstudio.com\/blog\/quick-guide-to-holiday-seo\">A Quick Guide to Holiday SEO<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Social Media for the Holidays<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Pinterest:<\/strong> It\u2019s a great idea to <strong>create infographics on Pinterest with product collections for gift ideas (\u201cgifts for her\/him\/kids\/etc\u201d) during October<\/strong>.

You can, of course, plan certain posts even earlier if you have fixed sale dates and know the exact messages you\u2019re going to share for the different holidays.

While the tone may be more subdued and serious this holiday season, we\u2019ve all been living in a post-COVID world for some time now and don\u2019t expect businesses to hold back on the promotions and sales that keep them running.
