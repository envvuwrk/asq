The question is perfectly understandable \u2014 this is your business\u2019s hard-earned money we\u2019re talking about here! It\u2019s also, unfortunately, notoriously difficult to answer. We\u2019ll take a look at why that is, then introduce you to two types of ROI (immediate and compounding) that can help you make sense of your digital marketing timeline.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Marketing Is An Ecosystem&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/FeZwxxlY2ncdYA4rfzKe_UGUSmAVZ4sFAODRXYuaedJQJnt6oS_ipDq9CM0lR_pGG7Cf3UaqGcxhXrru_9GXu6CHo1ZeGf-9J_86Lv3bJAND9IusxUVgzB4OU_UdPg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>Digital marketing ROI becomes more intuitive when you stop thinking about each individual strategy as a lever and start thinking about it as a small part of a vast ecosystem.  Each strategy impacts, and is impacted by, the others. <\/p>\n<p>Picture a group of lush, thriving trees in a forest. Those trees can influence their environment for the better, but they can&#8217;t transform the forest single-handedly &#8212; too much depends on the other vegetation and the wildlife, soil, weather patterns, and more. Similarly, stand-alone strategies like SEO, PPC or email marketing won\u2019t vastly shift the course of a business by themselves, but they will reinforce a positive direction or reduce the sharp incline of a negative one.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you purchased 20 hours of SEO services per month from a top-notch SEO agency. We can assume you\u2019re receiving high-quality work, but is it enough to move the needle? That depends on what the rest of your ecosystem looks like. Consider the following scenarios:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol><li>You sell a great product, your site is beautiful, you\u2019ve found your market fit, and you\u2019re running other strategies in tandem with SEO.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n<ol start=\"2\"><li>You sell a great product, your site is beautiful, you\u2019ve found your market fit, and SEO is your only marketing strategy.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n<ol start=\"3\"><li>Your website has issues, but your product is sound and there\u2019s convincing evidence of market fit.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n<ol start=\"4\"><li>You\u2019re in an oversaturated market and there\u2019s nothing that makes your product unique or better than the competition. You haven\u2019t found a niche target audience and you\u2019re not running other marketing strategies.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n<ol start=\"5\"><li>Your website is brand new and your product or business is markedly flawed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n<p>Now think about the impact of 20 monthly hours of SEO on each of the above. In scenario 1, SEO will grease the wheels of an already functioning system, simultaneously building off and reinforcing the other marketing efforts. The impact will be significant. This is also true, to a lesser extent, with scenario 2; you may need to invest in other strategies to get over the hump, but your SEO results won\u2019t leave you guessing and you\u2019ll consider your money well spent. Scenario 3 is a bit of a wildcard; it\u2019s equally likely that SEO will make a difference or fall flat. If you want more predictable results, get yourself to scenarios 1 or 2.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we have scenarios 4 and 5. In both of these cases, you\u2019re unlikely to see the results you want or expect, and you\u2019ll probably walk away feeling like you\u2019ve wasted your money.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In any of these scenarios, did the quality of your SEO work change? No. But you needed to satisfy the right conditions before the work could take effect.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Meet Joe and Jane: Compounding and Immediate ROI&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/Go0pKu9_9gFWbk4lJT68IgiYq5ZfnyfC7dZwO3eZ6SNhfa5mLRwX1zt0F2H7YWT_8i_4E5qSKxsIp_IRDLb9EH-O1CDJTawHZ4BhQJRuJvellrPm8b_9iu3QM2Yl3w\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>Grounded in the marketing-as-ecosystem philosophy? Good. It\u2019s time to introduce you to our friends Joe and Jane, who will provide the framework for understanding marketing timelines and results.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Joe <\/strong>would like to borrow $25. He\u2019ll pay you $30 back next week, which is all the money he owes you plus $5 for your trouble. Joe represents immediate ROI.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jane <\/strong>would also like to borrow $25. She can\u2019t pay you back in full by next week, though. Instead, she can give you $1 next week, $2 the next, $3 the next, and so on for the next three years. Jane represents compounding ROI.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Will you give your money to Joe or Jane? It doesn\u2019t take a math whiz to figure out that over time, Jane\u2019s return will be much higher than Joe\u2019s. Doesn\u2019t that make Jane a no-brainer?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Not necessarily. If you\u2019re ready to say goodbye to your $25 for seven weeks \u2014 ie, take a <em>seven-week leap of faith<\/em> on Jane \u2014 then by all means, choose Jane. But Joe offers something appealing too: liquidity. Because Joe can pay you back next week, you\u2019ll be able to respond to any changes that come up next week with your full $30. You could address an emergency, jump on a temporary buying opportunity, or reinvest your money. If the same emergencies or buying opportunities come up next week and you\u2019ve given your money to Jane, you\u2019re out of luck.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our numbers make this example sort of silly; $25 or $30 barely makes a dent for most people, so you&#8217;d have little incentive to pick Joe. But what if we used $25,000 instead of $25? Now we can see the benefit of having $30,000 next week, come what may.&nbsp;We can also clearly see the benefit of letting that investment compound. <\/p>\n<p>So one more time: Joe or Jane? The answer is&#8230;it\u2019s a trick question.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Joe Strategies vs Jane Strategies&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Most businesses benefit from a blend of Jane and Joe strategies \u2014 which is to say, a blend of slow-building, long-term initiatives and more immediate initiatives that bring in less ROI in the long run. The blend that\u2019s right for <em>your <\/em>business depends on the amount of cash you have on hand, your personal risk tolerance, and your long-term goals. Before you can find that blend, though, you&#8217;ll need to know which strategies belong to each category so you can assess their results on an appropriate timeline. Ordered from longest timeline to shortest, here\u2019s what we\u2019re working with:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Jane Strategies (Long-Term ROI)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul><li>Content strategy&nbsp;<\/li><li>Social media&nbsp;<\/li><li>SEO&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n<h4><strong>Joe Strategies (Near-Term ROI)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul><li>Google Shopping feeds&nbsp;<\/li><li>PPC&nbsp;<\/li><li>Other paid advertising&nbsp;<\/li><li>Email marketing&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>There are also feathered fish that don\u2019t fit into either category, like website design. You can see the results of those efforts immediately, but they also pay off over the long run.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As you look over this list, you might notice two other key differences between Joe and Jane strategies:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol><li><strong>Joe strategies are conditional<\/strong> \u2014 When you stop paying for them, they stop working for you. Jane strategies are <strong>not <\/strong>conditional; if you stop investing in content or SEO for a bit, the content you\u2019ve already created will continue working for you.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Joe strategies are easier to measure<\/strong> \u2014 It\u2019s comparatively easy to attribute revenue to the corresponding initiative when you\u2019re working with Joe. Jane strategies are tougher to pin down. If someone lands on a great piece of content and becomes brand-aware, but doesn\u2019t convert until a year later when they actually need the product, it\u2019s hard to attribute that conversion to a single piece of content. Muddier still, it\u2019s less likely that a <em>single <\/em>piece of content inspired the conversion and more likely that an aggregate of content created a consistent, positive experience over time (which inspired the conversion).&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n<h3><strong>Okay, But&#8230;When Will I See Results?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/eBzx7fz-yO7TsR-VzIFycwPojX-OpZu-tG4-icB0pwWsFj1DULEYT0RL4KSjHhdDl2fjTyTQ8hQ_orgSRxjS5mv8bLewU2SoYYBEZxGPQmQ7OU6pKkMVcd9UIQ4Q5Q\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>We know, we know&#8230;you didn\u2019t come here to learn about Joe and Jane. It\u2019s just difficult to ballpark timelines without knowing the state of the whole ecosystem. Here are some rough timelines: <\/p>\n<ul><li><strong>Social media and content strategy<\/strong> \u2014 This ranges from immediate (you produce a piece of content or post that makes some people convert instantly) to years (people build brand awareness and trust over time and don\u2019t convert until they develop a need). Someone might love Geico\u2019s content long before they have a reason to look at insurance rates. Does that mean it was a waste for Geico to reach them so early? Would <em>you <\/em>buy insurance from a brand you\u2019ve never heard of?&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><strong>SEO <\/strong>\u2014 3-6 months to rank for realistic keywords, less time if your site already has significant traction or authority. <em>Much <\/em>less time if your topic is time-sensitive or newsworthy and Google\u2019s \u201cfreshness\u201d algorithm kicks in, making it prioritize the most recent content on the subject (Google &#8220;presidential election&#8221; and you&#8217;ll see today&#8217;s news, not last week&#8217;s). Add more time if there\u2019s not a lot going on with your site, at which point your best option is an incremental long-tail strategy.\u00a0<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><strong>PPC and other paid advertising<\/strong> \u2014 Three months to test ideas and properly optimize your campaign. Individual conversions can happen near-immediately, but it will take time to land on the ROAS that makes your investment worth it.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Google Shopping<\/strong> \u2014 Once you submit a feed, expect to wait up to three days for product approval. The timeline for this one is deceptive because there\u2019s a lot of front-loading prior to submitting the feed, plus it takes about three months to accrue enough data to optimize the campaign.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Email marketing<\/strong> \u2014 Near-immediate (individual conversions) to months (to find the secret sauce that appeals to your customer base).&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Again, these are broad strokes that describe an \u201caverage\u201d business, which probably looks nothing like yours. It\u2019s a start, though.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The next time you\u2019re tempted to ask, \u201cHow long will it take to see results?\u201d ask instead: Is this a Joe strategy (near-term, conditional ROI) or a Jane strategy (long-term, compounding ROI)? What are the benefits and drawbacks of using such a strategy? Am I using a mix of strategies? Is my business\u2019s ecosystem healthy?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The answers to those questions might not be tidy numbers, but they\u2019ll get you more grounded in what you\u2019re paying for and what to expect. That will help you make smarter, more context-driven marketing decisions in the future. And <em>that <\/em>drives results.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s one of the most common questions we get at Grow With Studio: how long will it take to see return on&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":33,"featured_media":7428,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"image","meta":[],"categories":[219],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.9.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How Long Does It Take to See Digital Marketing Results? - Grow With Studio<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"When will your investment in digital marketing pay off?
