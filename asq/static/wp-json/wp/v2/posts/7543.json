And while it\u2019s common in the ecommerce world to think of the holidays from the sales angle, the savviest merchants also consider the holidays a marketing tool. Think about it: for a whole month, hungry shoppers will be discovering your site for the first time or even introducing your brand to friends and loved ones via gift-giving. <\/p>\n<p>Reaching that new pool of shoppers is a crucial goal, but it\u2019s not the only one; <em>retaining <\/em>those customers is your endgame. Here are six ways to create an unboxing experience that will keep &#8217;em coming back for more: <\/p>\n<h2>1. <strong>Use Packaging Materials That Reflect Your Brand Values\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/bz9CmFh50zWzRw1IzLiXQtNVsx_NZpho6qu0CS3aiCQnznQmHlmfkLa1_Gn2A9rV_Ms3oAUP3tDjqHyhLG_sPw6zDm4byBF3M-nwQMgHp3EAFVk8HTj3FX-QH948vA\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>While this tip won\u2019t be applicable for every ecommerce business, it\u2019s something to keep in mind if you: a) actively espouse environmentally conscious brand values, or b) target an audience known for being conscious consumers. If sustainable values tie in with your brand, make sustainable packaging and shipping choices. Ditch the plastic and opt for paperboard; use biodegradable packing peanuts (fun fact: some of the most popular ones are made from cornstarch!); and on an ongoing basis, re-evaluate how much packaging you actually need.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Now, the catch is that eco-friendly packaging (infuriatingly) isn\u2019t the cheapest option, and that can put budget-conscious businesses in a tough place. So the first step is to think about what you can <em>reduce<\/em>, not what you can <em>replace<\/em>. Bath and body shop Lush, for example, famously sells their products \u201cnaked,\u201d or sans packaging. That\u2019s convenient for Lush for a couple of reasons: 1) It aligns with their vocal support of the environment, and 2) They don\u2019t have to pay premium for eco-friendly packaging. It may not be realistic for every business to go \u201cnaked,\u201d but you can often spot little ways to reduce your packaging. Not every product in a set needs to be individually wrapped, for example.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>2. <strong>Let Your Customers Get Creative\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This admittedly makeshift cat house (I\u2019m a marketer, not a carpenter, okay?) wasn\u2019t supposed to be more than a fun diversion I\u2019d recycle the next day:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-ZH0ElNcLjvh9Pz6Cb3ZYvCWxAF70fYpUrAO4hgyduworp2fC6iKDOiYCWoaR5cLhUJBmB-5M7QvZWHTmGNq9Jhbj64qqTjBc_Wk0P5Wc3dcdTo3v7pWNlpHYHaWqw\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>&#8230;But my cat loves it, so now it\u2019s a permanent fixture in his kitty corner. A new cat tree came in that box. On the side of the box, the brand actually suggested doing this very thing and making a cat house. They even offered illustrations and instructions that I promptly ignored. It was a clever way to engage me in some fun, and now I\u2019m stuck looking at their branded box all the time.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Cardboard boxes and other packaging can be put to many different uses \u2014 just think creatively! If you sell kids\u2019 products, finding a clever use for the box will be a no-brainer (games, puzzles, paper airplane instructions, etc). If you sell makeup, tell your customers how to convert your packaging into storage containers or brush holders. Other verticals that can think \u201cstorage\u201d include apparel, office supplies, and food. Have some fun! Your customers aren\u2019t always worried about creating a masterpiece. Sometimes it\u2019s more about the convenience, or even just having a way to procrastinate for a few minutes (lookin\u2019 at you, cat house).\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>3. <strong>Include Promotional Materials and Offers<\/strong><\/h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/8aAezIG4cFvyNy-hLjoaTyVlXnsNbc-RHWpYZSraWm8ZvlR5ZmyUeW-ZRCka0c8VPC5XfWkdAb3ziVUH5NO-x3w4tVqww9kq0WbHDtQqmLka3fe0FOWdC45-UOh5CQ\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>Adding coupons, discounts on related products, and other promotional materials to every shipment is <em>way <\/em>more targeted \u2014 and less annoying \u2014 than sending junk mail out into the wild. You can assume the materials will be reasonably well-received, and they give your customer a tangible incentive to come back to your shop. Don\u2019t forget to encourage reviews and email subscriptions too!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I have a brand called <a href=\"https:\/\/cocofloss.com\/\">Cocofloss<\/a> to thank for the strangest, yet most memorable, experience I\u2019ve had with shipping inserts. They included a printed hard copy of their latest newsletter with my purchase! They didn\u2019t have to spend much money on it \u2014 they\u2019d used an ordinary Inkjet printer on ordinary paper, so the newsletter looked a bit like a kids\u2019 menu at a restaurant \u2014 but I found it oddly endearing. It also gave me a good taste of Cocofloss\u2019s brand voice and clued me in on what to expect if I signed up for their newsletter.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>4. <strong>If You Use Amazon, Know Your Loopholes<\/strong><\/h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/Lgf7owlE_OGY6VGERMv3bMKIcTauEMiW_LvY5AAu53rXcfnqlI_HsjCxGs1GmM5npB996NnUHvLs28flP9kd51q-pvCIRRwzNfu5JeUREawyFU2cXMTYkULuRA3zHg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>If you sell your products through Amazon, you already know that including any materials pointing your customers back to your website or another off-platform location is a no-go. That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t loopholes. The biggest one is the box itself: you can usually use your own branded boxes and include useful information on the box. While that doesn&#8217;t mean you can add your website address, you can generally get away with including your customer support number. <\/p>\n<p>If you sell technical products or other items that have complicated setup instructions, you can also film videos of the setup process and encourage people to go online and view them. Opportunities like this get customers out of the Amazon bubble where you have more freedom to promote your website and brand.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t flagrantly violate the rules, of course, especially if you rely on Amazon for a good portion of your revenue. Just think laterally about what might be genuinely helpful for your customers.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>5. <strong>Include Freebies and Samples\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/1tiaJKs9cXH1rJzJ-B3wToZKwNRX9JukllWJ4lWUu3T1gSB1HuKNfeJny47S8YeADFDN6heNt3WeR6pKkywm0gAXCBFmbzM7gGUs1cev3-6wBtQ_zNwnU09qVSIeHQ\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<p>If you sell food, skincare, makeup, or other products that are sample-friendly, do not underestimate the power of the sample! Not only do samples introduce the customer to another product they might fall in love with, but a lot of people actually consider samples an extra incentive to shop with the brand. There are people who actively shop with the makeup company Sephora, for example, because they know they get to add two free samples to their cart every time they shop.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>6. <strong>Make Setup Instructions as Useful as Possible\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>We touched on filming step-by-step setup videos and other tutorials in the Amazon section, but it&#8217;s not just a loophole. When you give your customers plenty of ways to understand the information you\u2019re sharing with them, you create a better user experience across the board. The more technical the product\/difficult the setup, the more true this is. IKEA\u2019s famous disembodied hand instructions might work for their furniture, but instructions like that are difficult to follow for all but the simplest projects.\u00a0<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/sA0RV1x4kQV5dl_ZgV3SgeLd3OCscQC2n0ybvkECriyPYGUCNWMc3s5pGWuoZyfn1K4dWhXjPkbjNyLNUMyvDQjGMZcbZLwxVD7pmc_C4OU1o2x9ewmIzBZlkeKHrw\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption>&#8220;Put books under your furniture.&#8221;<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The most user-friendly thing you can do is offer a variety of learning formats: text, illustrations, actual photographs, and prominent information about where to go to watch videos (and who to call for hands-on support).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s obviously preferable to have someone deeply familiar with your products write instructions, beware the \u201ccurse of knowledge.\u201d This is the curse experts in <em>every <\/em>field face (and storytellers too) when it\u2019s time to communicate information to a layman. It\u2019s easy to forget that what\u2019s intuitive and unspoken for you isn\u2019t that way for everyone else. The curse of knowledge can create skipped steps, missed critical details, and seeming leaps in logic.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, there\u2019s an easy way to combat the curse of knowledge: find a friend or family member who\u2019s game (and ideally, not great at following setup instructions \u2014 I would be a perfect candidate) and supervise them as they follow the product&#8217;s assembly instructions and set it up. Pay attention <em>every single time<\/em> your guinea pig gets something wrong or expresses frustration, then invite them to give feedback on the process once it\u2019s over. Avoid the \u201cOh, they just don\u2019t get it\u201d line of thinking, because it\u2019s <em>your <\/em>responsibility to put in extra effort to be understood. It\u2019s not your audience\u2019s responsibility to put in extra effort to understand you. That\u2019s not just true in business; it\u2019s true for writing and communication in general.\u00a0 <\/p>\n<p>Have some fun and think creatively, and you won\u2019t just see sales this holiday season. You\u2019ll also develop long-term relationships with customers who will happily return to your shop again and again!&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The holiday season is nearly upon us!
