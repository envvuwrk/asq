It\u2019s always best to run a few different versions of your ads at a time so you have the ability to A\/B test, and the holiday season provides a great opportunity to be festive with your ad copy. Test out a few different versions of your ad, but don\u2019t stop there. Consider different calls to action and different landing pages for your ads as well. Sometimes making even a minor, seemingly insignificant change in ad copy or headline text <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designforfounders.com\/ab-testing-examples\/\">can produce huge results<\/a>. Look at every aspect of your ad experience, and consider which elements or variables are worth testing out.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>On a similar note, get creative with your promotions and your site itself. Make a holiday product bundle at a discounted price, or create different promotions to see which performs better. For example, do your shoppers respond more positively to a flat $10 off, or are they more enticed with a 15% coupon code? Dress up your site pages with fun new visuals or banners, maybe even create whole new pages on your site specifically devoted to showcasing and calling out your holiday sales.\u00a0<\/p>\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n<h2><strong>Increase Your Focus, And Your Budget<\/strong><\/h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.growwithstudio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/increase-your-budget-paid-ad-prep.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5568\" srcset=\"https:\/\/3841ex3t1et33uno5h3thxr7-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/increase-your-budget-paid-ad-prep.jpg 800w, https:\/\/3841ex3t1et33uno5h3thxr7-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/increase-your-budget-paid-ad-prep-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/3841ex3t1et33uno5h3thxr7-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/increase-your-budget-paid-ad-prep-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s pretty common knowledge that Q4 is make or break time for many small ecommerce businesses, and that during this time companies of all sizes stand to make huge returns. As such, it stands to reason that the advertising landscape will be much more fierce, with increased marketing budgets and new competitors entering the space. So during this crucial time, it\u2019s important to stay extra focused and make a plan.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Create audience lists months in advance. Look specifically to identify users based on shopping intent, creating different lists for shoppers at different stages of the sales funnel. In addition to a list of all visitors, look to create separate audience lists for people who viewed a product, added an item to their cart, completed a purchase, or visited a particularly important page on your site. Use <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2472738?hl=en\">remarketing ads<\/a> using these audience lists to engage with potential buyers, creating different ads based on which audience you\u2019re dealing with. Someone put an item in their cart, but didn\u2019t complete the purchase? Maybe include a special coupon code in your remarketing ad that\u2019s only for cart abandoners.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the reality of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">Google Ads Auction<\/a> system means that when other businesses increase their marketing budgets, it creates a more competitive landscape for all other advertisers as well. As such, it\u2019s probably in your best interest to review campaign bids and budgets, and to increase spend where you\u2019d like to be more competitive. This influx of competition can also serve as a good opportunity to do your own research, however. Identify a few main competitors and see what kind of deals they\u2019re offering. See which ads show up next to you on search result pages and compare your ads to theirs. All\u2019s fair in love and advertising, after all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n<h2><strong>Automate Where You Can<\/strong><\/h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.growwithstudio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/automate-your-ads-for-the-holidays.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5569\" srcset=\"https:\/\/3841ex3t1et33uno5h3thxr7-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/automate-your-ads-for-the-holidays.jpg 800w, https:\/\/3841ex3t1et33uno5h3thxr7-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/automate-your-ads-for-the-holidays-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/3841ex3t1et33uno5h3thxr7-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/automate-your-ads-for-the-holidays-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s important to make sure your paid search campaigns are getting all the attention they deserve, and are never put on the dreaded \u201cset it and forget it\u201d mode. At some point, though, you\u2019re going to be too preoccupied filling orders and managing other aspects of your business to be able to dive too deep into your <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/6098241?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6031980\">ever growing Google Ads campaign<\/a>. When this happens, it\u2019s a good idea to look into utilizing tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.google.com\/home\/tools\/ads-editor\/\">Google Ads Editor<\/a>, which allows you to make bulk changes to existing campaigns, even while offline.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Taking things a bit further \u2014 if you\u2019re comfortable with implementing javascript, then the world of campaign automation really opens up. Google has a great list of <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/google-ads\/scripts\/docs\/examples\">free scripts<\/a> for everything from bid adjustments that trigger when certain conditions are met, to automated campaign reporting. There are also a few tools within the Google Ads interface that can help with automation. By utilizing a mixture of location, time of day, and device bidding, you can optimize your campaigns and feel confident in letting them run to your specifications.<\/p>\n<p>One last tactic to test out would be running a Dynamic Search Ads campaign. This type of campaign works a little differently than you may be used to, using on-page content to match your ad with relevant search terms. This type of campaign can be a good way to gather keywords to bid on in your other campaigns, and generally helps to ensure all aspects of your site are captured and utilized in your marketing efforts.\u00a0<\/p>\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n<h2><strong>Get Started Early<\/strong><\/h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.growwithstudio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/start-early-paid-ads-marketing.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5570\" srcset=\"https:\/\/3841ex3t1et33uno5h3thxr7-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/start-early-paid-ads-marketing.jpg 800w, https:\/\/3841ex3t1et33uno5h3thxr7-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/start-early-paid-ads-marketing-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/3841ex3t1et33uno5h3thxr7-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/start-early-paid-ads-marketing-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<p>The holiday season is fast approaching, and while it may seem like there\u2019s still plenty of time to spare, but a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/consumer-insights\/four-types-holiday-shoppers\">recent report by Google<\/a> itself reveals that people are more and more likely to browse and purchase over a longer period of time, and not necessarily only look for those blockbuster sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
