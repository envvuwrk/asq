By putting together a product feed file and submitting it to a search engine like Google, an advertiser is empowered to advertise on one of the fastest growing advertising platforms available. And because you\u2019re submitting your product information directly to Google, there\u2019s also a great level of transparency not normally seen in online advertising, as these ads will display your product\u2019s image, name, and price right up front and center. Because of this, users have a pretty good sense of what you\u2019re offering, and this translates into generally lower click costs and higher click through and conversion rates than a comparable text ad. \u201cBut what can we do to maximize our chances to get our products shown in the sea of other websites out there\u201d you\u2019re probably asking. Well, an excellent place to start is with your product titles and descriptions.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"696\" height=\"375\" src=\"https:\/\/www.growwithstudio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Group-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5005\" srcset=\"https:\/\/3841ex3t1et33uno5h3thxr7-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Group-10.jpg 696w, https:\/\/3841ex3t1et33uno5h3thxr7-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Group-10-300x162.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" \/><\/figure>\n<h3>Product Titles and Descriptions are Important<br><\/h3>\n<p>Shopping ads share a lot of similarities with text ads, but there\u2019s one huge difference that sets them apart &#8211; they do not utilize keywords. With a text ad, we\u2019re able to bid on &nbsp;both broad and specific search terms in order to tell Google how we want our ads to appear. For shopping ads, however, we\u2019re bidding on the product itself, not a search term. Because of this, the way Google\u2019s algorithm calculates relevance is a bit different. Google will crawl your product pages and index on page content such as your product\u2019s title, description, image and price. It then uses this information to pair your items with relevant search terms, taking your product bid into account as well. For this reason, it becomes pretty important to have product titles and descriptions that are rich with information and provide as much utility to Google and end users alike. <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h3>Front Load Relevant Information<br><\/h3>\n<p>A shopping ad will display an image of your product, as well as its title and price. For the search engine\u2019s benefit, it\u2019s important to have as much information as reasonably possible, but from a user experience standpoint, these ads have a character limit when being displayed, and people won\u2019t be able to read all one thousand characters of your beautifully verbose product title. Put the most important information that you want people to see first, as that\u2019s going to be what they\u2019re actually able to read. Google also values front loaded content, as it&#8217;s pretty natural to have critical information listed first. Good examples of information to front load would be brand, size, or color information, or if the item is part of a bundle or sold in bulk. <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h3>Learn to Talk to Robots<br><\/h3>\n<p>In order to best set ourselves up for success, it\u2019s important to understand the differences in how search engines and humans process information on product pages. A human being has the benefit of things like common sense and understanding context. When presented with an item that has a fairly vague name, such as a handbag that\u2019s simply named \u201cChelsea\u201d (a real life example of a site I saw once), a person is able to see the product image, understand that it\u2019s a handbag, probably get a decent idea of what it\u2019s made out of and maybe even its dimensions, and come away with a much better idea of what that product is all about. A search engine like Google simply wouldn\u2019t know what to do with this product, however. When writing your product titles and descriptions, assume that you\u2019re talking to a robot, toddler, or alien that only understands and has knowledge of the information you physically write out. Identifying things like color, materials, and dimensions will go a long way in arming search engines with the power to match your items with relevant search results. The more information you\u2019re able to give, the better!<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What are Shopping Ads?
